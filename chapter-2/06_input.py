# This function allows the user to take input from the keyboard as a string.

A = input ("enter first name: ") # if a is "harry", the user entered harry
B = input('Enter last name: ')

a = int(input ("enter a number: ")) # if a is "harry", the user entered harry
b = int(input('Enter a number: '))

print("This is first name", A)
print("This is last name", B)

'''It is important to note that the output of input is always a string (even is a number is
entered).'''
